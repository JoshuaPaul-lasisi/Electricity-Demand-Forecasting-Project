# **Electricity Demand and Price Forecasting Project**

## **Overview**
The Electricity Demand and Price Forecasting project leverages historical energy production and weather data to predict two critical variables: total electricity demand (load) and electricity price. These forecasts help energy providers manage grid operations more efficiently, minimize waste, and optimize costs. We utilized machine learning models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to provide reliable forecasts. Additionally, this project explores the influence of weather factors such as temperature and wind speed on energy consumption and generation, offering valuable insights into electricity demand trends.

## **Key Features**
- Predicts total electricity load and price using machine learning models.
- Utilizes energy generation and weather data for improved forecasting accuracy.
- Includes detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships.

## **Technologies Used**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## **Conclusion**
The project provides accurate forecasts for electricity demand and price, offering valuable insights that can assist energy providers in making informed decisions. Future improvements include incorporating advanced models like XGBoost and deploying the model for real-time forecasting.
